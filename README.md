# excelPrimeNumberChecker

This application reads positive 32 bits integers from .xlsx file and prints out prime numbers to console.

App supports only 32 bit numbers. This is because some big numbers (bigger than 32 bit numbers) can consume really big amount of time to determine if it is prime number or not.
